Project Overview:

This project is a hybrid machine learning model designed to analyze unstructured IoT data by combining clustering and semi-supervised classification.
Folder Structure:

Source_Code/: Contains the main code for the hybrid model.
Main_Document.pdf: Detailed report on the solution and results.
Case_Study.pdf: Case study explaining the problem, approach, and recommendations.
How to Run the Code:

Requirements: Install required packages (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib) with pip install 
Run: Execute the main file (main.py or Hybrid_Model.ipynb) in a Python environment.
Data File: Place iot_data.csv in the same directory or update the file path in the code.
File Descriptions:

iot_data.csv: Example dataset.
main.py or Hybrid_Model.ipynb: Main Python file containing the code.
